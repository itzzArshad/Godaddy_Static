		<p><strong>FAVOURITE PLACE :</strong></p>
		<p1>I always wonder by seeing the place called Warangal Fort.
		<p2>Warangal Fort is located in Warangal District, Telangana, India. It was the capital city of Kakatiya dynasty and Musunuri Nayakas. It appears to have existed since at least the 12th century when it was the capital of the Kakatiyas. The fort has four ornamental gates, known as Kakatiya Kala Thoranam, that originally formed the entrances to a now ruined great Shiva temple. The Kakatiyan arch has been adopted and officially incorporated into the emblem of Telangana after the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh. The fort is included in the "tentative list" of UNESCO World Heritage Site and was submitted by the Permanent Delegation of India to UNESCO on 10/09/2010.

		<!-- Quotations -->
		<blockquote cite="http://inspirationalquoteswallpaper.blogspot.com/2011/03/kakatiya-kala-thoranam-warangal-fort.html">
			<strong>The design of the gateways is redolent like the ‘thoranas’ of the Great Stupa at Sanchi. The architecture and sculpture of these temples are magnificent as no one can fail to see the rich imagination, patient industry and skilful workmanship of the builders of the temples of the Kakatiya period.</strong>
